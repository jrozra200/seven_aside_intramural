# Soccer Team Rotation Schedule Generator

A React-based web application that generates fair rotation schedules for 7-a-side intramural soccer games with 7-10 players.

**[Live Demo](https://jrozra200.github.io/seven_aside_intramural/)**

## Overview

This tool helps coaches and team organizers create balanced playing time schedules for soccer games with:
- 4 quarters divided into 8 half-quarters
- 6 field positions + 1 goalkeeper (7 players on field)
- Automatic rotation to ensure fair playing time
- Customizable player names and goalkeeper assignments

## Features

- **Flexible Team Sizes**: Support for 7-10 players
- **Fair Rotation Algorithm**: Automatically distributes playing time evenly across all players
- **Goalkeeper Management**: Assign different goalkeepers per quarter (plays entire quarter)
- **Visual Schedule**: Clear display of who plays, who's benched, and when substitutions occur
- **Playing Time Summary**: Track total half-quarters played per player

## How It Works

### Game Structure
- **4 Quarters** with substitutions at half-time (8 total half-quarters)
- **7 Players** on field at any time (6 field + 1 goalkeeper)
- **Goalkeepers** stay for the entire quarter (both half-quarters)
- **Field players** rotate at each half-quarter break

### Rotation Algorithm
The schedule prioritizes:
1. Players with fewer plays in the current quarter
2. Players with fewer total plays overall
3. Players who haven't played recently

This ensures everyone gets approximately equal playing time while minimizing consecutive benching.

## Usage

1. **Select Number of Players** (7-10)
2. **Enter Player Names** (optional, defaults to "Player 1", "Player 2", etc.)
3. **Assign Goalkeepers** for each quarter
4. **Generate Schedule** - Click the button to create the rotation

The schedule will display:
- Which players are on the field each half-quarter
- Who stays on the field vs who substitutes
- Who's on the bench
- Total playing time per player

   git clone https://github.com/jrozra200/seven_aside_intramural.git
   cd seven_aside_intramural
   ```

2. Set up a React project with Tailwind CSS
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install lucide-react
   ```
4. Import and use the `SoccerRotation` component
